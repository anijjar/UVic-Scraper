# Learning In Motion - Co-op Posting Scrapper

This here is a simple Python script that will gather job postings from the University of Victoria's Job Bullin board on Learning in Motion. This script will break if they decide to make major changes to the source code, but I doubt it. Although in that case, the script will need to be updated.  

In the future, I hope to implement features such as:
- Filtering new postings with old ones.
- Searching for key words.
- Submit applications via gui.
- Anything else I can think of.

Feel free to modify this as you wish. Currently, I am facing issues with pyinstaller so no nice executables, but you can run it as a regular script via "python app.py"

**UPDATE**
They updated the UI. This script does not work anymore üòê. Good thing though because I found out years later that this was not alowed....
